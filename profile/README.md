## Trilinos

The Trilinos Project is a community of developers, users and
user-developers focused on collaborative creation of algorithms and
enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework
for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering
and scientific problems on new and emerging high-performance computing
(HPC) architectures.  Trilinos is composed of packages addressing
various computational needs of engineering and scientific simulations.

The Trilinos Project is part of the nonprofit [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org).
